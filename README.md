This project aims to develop a machine learning model for categorizing individuals into different risk groups for hyperthyroidism. Through comprehensive data preprocessing and the implementation of supervised learning techniques, including both baseline and ensemble methods, the model demonstrates promising results in accurately predicting hyperthyroidism risk levels. Ensemble learning models, particularly Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and LightGBM Classifier, outperform baseline models, showcasing their effectiveness in early disease detection. By providing a user-friendly interface and deploying the model on a cloud platform, this project seeks to enhance healthcare outcomes by offering an accessible tool for hyperthyroid risk assessment.

Objectives
Implement comprehensive data preprocessing techniques to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset.
Train various machine learning models to accurately predict hyperthyroidism risk levels.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Develop a user-friendly interface and deploy the model on a cloud platform for real-world applications.
